# Grocery Store Price Scraping Australia

A Rust port of my [hotprices-au](https://github.com/Javex/hotprices-au)
implementation. I mostly wrote this as a learning exercise to get started with
Rust. It is currently unmaintained as the Python version worked better with
Playwright, among other things.
